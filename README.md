# KioxMar-Menu
## Overview

This project was developed for a specific version of **DayZ Private**, and includes the following external cheat features:

- ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)
- Aimbot
- X-Ray Vision

The graphical user interface was built using **ImGui**, providing a clean and user-friendly layout for interacting with the cheat features.

## Loader & Execution

The loader was designed as a **native application**. It encrypted the shellcode using **AES encryption** and injected it into a target process (such as `TeamSpeak`) using **process hollowing**. The loader was designed to minimize disk footprint to maintain stealth and reduce detection vectors.

> Note: This is an **external cheat**, not an internal one.
